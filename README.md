# Payment Gateway Exercise

## Preface

In every project I like to set myself a strict "hackathon-like" schedule. 
By setting a strict schedule I force myself to make hard design decisions, accept tradeoffs, simulate a real world scenario with a fixed deadline while also keeping myself focused and committed. 
In addition, I select a new technology or an idea that I would like to learn more about, explore and experiment with, to make things more interesting and learn something along the way.
